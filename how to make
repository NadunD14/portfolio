Create a complete, modern, and dark-themed developer portfolio website using **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**. The entire project must be structured for seamless deployment on **Vercel**.

**Design & Layout:**
1.  The overall aesthetic must be a **sleek, minimal, dark-mode design** inspired by the link: `https://itssharl.ee/fr`.
2.  Use clean typography and subtle hover effects.
3.  Include a main navigation (`Home`, `About`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Contact`).
4.  The main layout should be a single-page structure that scrolls through the sections.

**Content (Use these details for the respective sections):**
* **About/Profile Summary:** "A passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on building scalable, data-driven applications and leveraging cloud technologies to solve real-world challenges."
* **Key Technical Skills:** List the following groups:
    * **Programming:** Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP
    * **Web Development:** React, **Next.js**, Node.js, Express.js
    * **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
    * **Cloud & DevOps:** **AWS**, **Docker**, Apache Airflow
    * **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras, **Ollama**, **LangChain**
* **Projects:** Include a section with cards for at least these two projects:
    * **Project 1:** "Scalable real-time notification service deployed on AWS" (Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, Docker, AWS)
    * **Project 2:** "Langchain Project" (Description: A hands-on project exploring LangChain for building AI-driven natural language applications.)

**Core Feature: Gemini API Chatbot Integration**
1.  Implement a floating, minimal, persistent **AI Chatbot component** (like a chat bubble that opens a modal).
2.  The chatbot must use a Next.js **API Route** (e.g., `/api/chat/gemini`) to securely communicate with the **Google Gemini API** (`@google/generative-ai` SDK).
3.  The API route must load the API key from a secure environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
4.  Crucially, the Gemini model must be configured with a **System Instruction** (System Prompt) to act as a "Digital Assistant for **Nadun Sandanayaka**." The assistant should be polite and answer questions **EXCLUSIVELY** using the provided profile summary, skills, and project descriptions, refusing to answer non-related queries.

**Deliverables:** Provide the complete file structure and code for `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx` (with all sections), a basic `Chatbot` component, and the `/api/chat/gemini` API route.
